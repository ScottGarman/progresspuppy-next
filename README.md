# ProgressPuppy - FOSS Edition (Work in Progress Development Edition)

ProgressPuppy - FOSS Edition is a web-based productivity app whose main purpose is to manage your daily tasks. It's written in Ruby on Rails, and this codebase is derived from what's currently running at https://progresspuppy.com.

Using ProgressPuppy is intended to add some fun to completing your daily tasks. Upon task completion, a funny or motivating internet meme is displayed.

Not included in the FOSS Edition of the codebase are paid subscription plan definitions, payment processor code, predefined productivity quote packs, and production tooling that require site-specific setup such as exception notifications, email server settings, or app deployment. This code is intended to be useful for folks who want to self-host their own personal instance of ProgressPuppy.

I use ProgressPuppy on a daily basis and it still brings me joy. Sharing this code is my way of sharing that joy with others. Have fun!

## Current Status

This git repo under active development and is being used for a fresh rewrite of ProgressPuppy using the latest version of Rails and some of the newer best practices that weren't available when the project was originally started. It is a work in progress and is largely a background task for me to do in my free time, and will, er, "progress" very slowly. In the meantime, [progresspuppy-foss](https://github.com/ScottGarman/progresspuppy-foss) is the codebase you can use if you want to get started with ProgressPuppy immediately.
